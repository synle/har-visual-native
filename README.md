# har-visual-native

The `har-visual-native` is a desktop application that allows you to visualize your HTTP Archive (HAR) file, which is created from the inspector within your browser. This software is compatible with all major operating systems, including OSX, Windows, and Linux.

Additionally, the program automatically backs up your HAR content and creates a revision history similar to Git's commit history. This feature enables you to access your HAR file at a later time, even if the original file is no longer on your disk.
